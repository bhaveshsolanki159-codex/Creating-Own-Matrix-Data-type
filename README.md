# Matrix Calculator

## Overview
The **Matrix Calculator** is a Python-based console application that allows users to perform various matrix operations interactively. Users can input matrices of different sizes and perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, determinant calculation, inverse finding, and more.

## Features
- Addition of multiple matrices
- Subtraction of multiple matrices
- Matrix multiplication
- Transpose of a matrix
- Determinant calculation (for square matrices)
- Finding the inverse of a matrix (if possible)
- Matrix rank calculation
- Exponentiation of square matrices
- User-friendly console-based interaction
- Input validation and error handling

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- NumPy (for efficient matrix operations)

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install NumPy using pip if it's not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```
3. Download or clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bhaveshsolanki159-codex/Creating-Own-Matrix-Data-type.git
   cd Creating-Own-Matrix-Data-type
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the program using:
   ```bash
   python matrix.py
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter matrices and select operations.
3. The program will display the results after each operation.
